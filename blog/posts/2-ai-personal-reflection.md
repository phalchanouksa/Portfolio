# Why I Like AI

AI helps me make things faster. It is like a simple tool I can open anytime. I write a small idea, and it helps me turn it into something real.

I still want my work to feel like me. I try to use my own voice and be honest. I do not want my projects to look the same as everyone else.

Here are small things I want to try next:
- A tiny helper that cleans my notes.
- A tool that explains Khmer idioms in context.
- A simple loop: write → test → improve.

AI does not replace thinking. It just gives me a faster start. I still care about details and learning slowly.*** End Patch
